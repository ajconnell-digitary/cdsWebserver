        <h2 id="whatIsEdEx">What is EDExchange?</h2>
        <p>EDExchange is a web app that provides a secure network for exchanging documents between US educational organizations. EDExchange is open source, provides web services (SOAP and REST), and allows for customization. By becoming an EDExchange member you can send and receive documents at no cost in a secure and reliable way.</p>

        <h2 id="howItWorks">How Does EDExchange Work?</h2>
        <p>Behind the scenes, EDExchange is comprised of two servers:</p>
        <ul><li>A Directory Server</li><li>A Network Server</li></ul>
        <p>Why do you care about these two servers? Because your interactions with them will be determined by these questions:</p>
        <ul><li>Do you want to only Send documents?</li><li>Do you want to both Send and Receive documents?</li><li>Do you want to not choose either of these options and just be an EDExchange Member who contracts with Service Providers in the network to send and receive documents on their behalf.</li></ul>
        <p>If you choose to only send documents, you will register with EDExchange in the Directory Server web application as an "Institution" and you will use a Service Provider to receive documents on your behalf (most-likely a fee-based arrangement). If you choose to both send and receive documents, you will register as both an "Institution" AND as a "Service Provider" and you will also set up your own Network server for receiving documents. If you choose to register but not send or receive documents yourself, you will register as an Institution.</p>

        <h3 id="dirSer">The Directory Server</h3>
        <p>The Directory server is hosted and maintained by the PESC organization. It includes a directory of EDExchange members and all their related information. As an EDExchange member you can manage your organization through the Directory server web application UI. You can also manage operations using the hosted API that exposes directory information. The REST API allows you to manage users, endpoints, contacts, the signing certificate tasks as you would via the Directory server web app.</p>
        <p>After registering with EDExchange, the next tasks include configuration, setting up your Network Servers (if you elect to receive documents), making any customizations, and testing. Information to do all of this follows in the sections below.</p>
        <h3 id="netSer">The Network Server</h3>
        <p>The EDExchange Network Server is a server that hosts endpoints (a URL that can that receives documents). A Network Server must exist for each EDExchange member that is configured to be receive documents.</p>
        <p>A reference implementation of a Network Server can be used as a starting point for developing an EDExchange Network Server. The source code for the reference implementation of the Network Server can be found on <a href="https://github.com/owenwe/cdsWebserver.git">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>If you choose to use the reference implementation of the Network Server, there are certain tasks that need to be performed to make the reference implementation live for the member, which are explained in detail in the Developer section below. When administration and the optional Network Server are complete, then EDExchange users at your organization can begin using it to exchange documents.</p>

        <h3 id="rolesInEdEx">Roles in EDExchange</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An end-user administrator configures and maintains your organization's EDExchange account (end users, serviceable institutions, etc.)</li>
            <li>If you elect to receive documents and set up a Network Server:
                <ul><li>A System Administrator sets up and configures the Network Server</li>
                    <li>A developer at your organization will implement and perhaps customize the Network Server to handle any administration tasks via the SOAP or REST API.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="endUserAdmin">EDExchange End User Administrator Documentation</h2>
        <p>An EDExchange Administrator is the person at your organization who initially registers for EDExchange and uses the web application's user interface (UI) to configure things like: your organization contact information (web site, address, etc.), contacts, school codes, Service Providers, additional EDExchange users, and, if you elect to receive documents, serviced schools. Your initial first steps with EDExchange start with registration and PESC review. After registration, you will configure your organization in EDExchange. You may want to coordinate with a developer at your institution to set up a signing certificate and/or a Network Server and certificate before setting up users.</p>
        <p>Note that many of the UI tasks can also be accomplished by a developer using the EDExchange API. Any customizations and/or some of the Admin steps outlined here may be handed off to a developer at your organization or you may share some of these steps with the developer. It is noted throughout the steps below where a developer can use the Ed Exchange REST API to do the same task. A REST API is an application programming interface architecture that allows you to perform configuration and other actions programmatically instead of using the EDExchange UI.</p>

        <h3 id="regInEdEx">Step 1: Register in EDExchange</h3>
        <p>There are several ways for an organization to be added to the EDExchange network. New applicants can register by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>filling out the registration form in EDExchange web application</li>
            <li>being created by a Service Provider for the purpose of adding the institution to the provider's group of serviceable institutions</li>
            <li>having their registration created directly by a PESC administrator</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> Organizations that are registered in the first two ways must also be reviewed and approved by a PESC administrator. All new organizations' records are disabled upon registration in EDExchange. Once a PESC administrator approves an organization, it becomes enabled in the EDExchange directory.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Completing the Registration Form</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In your web browser, go to http://ec2-52-26-231-231.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/home#/home. FIXME: replace this w/the real URL.</li>
            <li>Click Sign Up (in the upper right corner) to display the Sign Up screen.</li>
            <li>Fill in all the required fields and be sure to select the Institution and/or Service Provider check box(es).
                <p><b>NOTE: </b>If you don't enter values in any required fields they display in red when you click Submit. If this happens, enter values in the required fields and click Submit again.</p>
                <p>Use the following information to help you select Institution or Service Provider:</p>
                <p><b>Institution: </b>If you only select the Institution check box, and do not select the Service Provider check box, then you will have the ability to send documents but not receive them. You will not need to set up and hose a Network Server as you will receive documents by contracting with a Service Provider who will receive them on your behalf. The benefit to this arrangement is you don't have to stand up and maintain a Network Server. The cost to you is whatever the Service Provider charges for providing the service of receiving documents on your behalf.</p>
                <p><b>Service Provider: </b>If you select Service Provider, you will also select Institution. This allows you to both send and receive documents. Your organization is considered both an "Institution" (can send) and a "Service Provider" (can receive documents) in EDExchange.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click Submit. A "Success" message displays saying that you'll be sent an email once your organization becomes activated (by PESC). You can log in and configure your organization to send and receive documents in the meantime (but cannot actually send and receive anything yet).</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            The EDExchange API is accessible using SOAP and REST based clients. A WSDL is accessible for
            each defined resource as shown on the <a href="services">services</a> page.
            The remainder of the API documentation is specific to the REST API and is intended to
            supplement the <a href="swagger-ui/index.html">interactive API documentation</a> by providing descriptions
            of higher level tasks.
            Tasks are typically composed of different API invocations on various resourcess to accomplish a goal.
        </p>

        <p>
            The EDExchange REST API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate
            API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood
            by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. We support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely
            with our API from a client-side web application. Depending on the value of the HTTP "Accept" header in each HTTP request,
            which must be one of "application/json" or "application/xml", JSON or XML is returned by all API responses,
            including errors.
        </p>

        <p>
            To make the API as explorable as possible, <a href="swagger-ui/index.html">interactive API documentation</a>
            has
            been provided. The interactive API documentation should be the primary source of information regarding API
            usage.
            In addition, for the purpose of testing end-to-end document delivery, endpoints can be
            designated for use in test mode or live mode. There is no "switch" for changing between modes,
            just use the appropriate endpoint to deliver a live or test document.
        </p>

        <h2 id="sample-code">Sample Code</h2>
        <p>
            EDExchange is an open source project.  The source code for both the EDExchange <a href="#directory-server">directory server</a>
            and the <a href="#network-server">network server</a> are available through github.  Most of the API operations that are used
            by institutions and service providers are implemented in the network server code.
        </p>
        <p>The network server project includes code for the following tasks:
            <ol>
                <li><a href="#receive-document">Receive a document</a> and all the logic that entails, including signature verification.</li>
                <li>Create a transaction to store send/receive information</li>
                <li><a href="#send-document">Send a document</a> and all that logic that entails including signature generation.</li>
                <li><a href="#create-serviceable-institution">Create a serviceable institution</a></li>
                <li>Updating organization information in the directory</li>
            </ol>
            Code for these tasks can be seen in the network server's implemenation itself, or in the unit tests.  The unit
            test classes have been named for easy identification of use cases.  For example, service provider tests are
            located in the "ServiceProviderUseCaseTests" and institution tests are in the "InstitutionUseCaseTests" and
            digital signature tests are in the "DigitalSignatureTests" Java classes.
            <p>
                It is likely that more sample code in the form of unit tests will be added to the network server project in the future.
            </p>
        </p>

        <h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>

        <p>
            The EDExchange API uses basic authentication.
            All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. Some API requests require authentication,
            and certain permissions.  In addition, HTTP methods that trigger side effects (e.g. POST, PUT, DELETE) require
            custom headers that protect against <a href="#csrf">cross site request forgery</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="errors">Errors</h2>

        <p>

            EDExchange uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.
            In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed
            given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, etc.), and codes
            in the 5xx range indicate an error with the EDExchange servers (these are rare).
            Not all errors map cleanly onto HTTP response codes, however. When a request is valid
            but does not complete successfully, we return a 402 error code. The following describes the
            components of an error message:

        </p>

        <div class="ed-title">Error Description</div>

        <p>
        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
            <dt>timestamp</dt>
            <dd>A time stamp when the error occured, i.e. System.currentTimeMillis().</dd>

            <dt>exception</dt>
            <dd>The kind of exception that occurred. This is an optional element.</dd>
            <dt>status</dt>
            <dd>The HTTP status code (same as the response status code).</dd>
            <dt>error</dt>
            <dd>The HTTP status code description (derived from the response status code).</dd>
            <dt>path</dt>
            <dd>The path that was requested.</dd>
            <dt>message</dt>
            <dd>A message which elaborates the problem in more detail.</dd>

        </dl>
        </p>


        <div class="ed-title">HTTP Status Code Usage</div>
        <p>
            404 is not used. When a resource cannot be found, an empty list is returned.
        </p>

        <dl class="dl-horizontal">

        <p>
            Certain resources that have large results sets can be paginated. Whenever pagination is available,
            EDExchange utilizes two query parameters <var>limit</var> and <var>offset</var> to specify the maximum
            number of records that should be returned, and where in the result set to start. EDExchange utilizes
            a custom HTTP header <var>X-Total-Count</var> in the response to indicate the total number of records
            in the result set.

        <h2 id="csrf">Cross Site Request Forgery</h2>

        <p>
            Cross-site request forgery, also known as one-click attack or session riding and abbreviated as
            CSRF (sometimes pronounced sea-surf) or XSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website where
            unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the website trusts.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Directory Server utilizes a method of CSRF protection called
            <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#Double_Submit_Cookie">double submit cookie</a>
            which requires client side generated CSRF tokens.

            With this technique, clients must generate and send the same unique secret value in both a cookie and a custom HTTP header.
            Because a website is only allowed to read/write a cookie for its own domain, only the real site can send the same value in both headers.
        </p>
        <p>
            For applications that are consuming the REST API directly with technology such as Spring's RestTemplate, the developer must generate a
            secret, for example "4a0e4a27220ceca2cfdaa7a338087a07e5" and include it in both the custom HTTP header <var>X-CSRF-TOKEN</var> and
            the <var>Cookie</var> header.  Example HTTP response headers are shown below (note the <var>X-CSRF-TOKEN</var> header and the <var>Cookie</var>
            headers).

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                HTTP requests that do not pass CSRF checks will fail and the server will return a 403 status code such as
                following:
                <pre>
    {
        "timestamp": 1470845258256,

        <p>
            Code examples in Java are provided as part of the directory server unit tests using Spring's RestTemplate.
        </p>

        <h2 id="directory-server">Directory Server</h2>

        <p>
            The EDExchange directory server maintains a directory of EDExchange members and all relateded information.
            This is the
            server that hosts the API and exposes the directory information. It is hosted and maintained by the<a
                href="www.pesc.org">PESC</a> organization.
            EDExchange members can also manage their organization through the directory server web application. Operations
            can be conducted using the REST API, including the management of users, endpoints, contacts
            and the signing certificate, and in many cases, through the directory server web application by an authenticated
            user with the appropriate permissions.
        </p>

        <h2 id="network-server">Network Server</h2>

        <p>
            The EDExchange network server is a server that hosts endpoints (a URL that can that receives documents). A network server must
            exist for each EDExchange member that is configured to be receive documents.

        <div id="reference-implementation">
            A reference implementation of a network server can be used as a starting point for developing an EDExchange
            network server.
            The source code for the reference implementation of the network server can be found on github using the
            following
            url:
            <pre><span th:text="${github}"></span></pre>

            <p>
                The project contains the source code for both the directory server and the reference implementation of the
                network server, so that a directory server can be run locally for testing purposes.  The network server is
                a complete solution in that it can securely send and receive documents
                over the EDExchange network.  Even so, many institutions will want to customize certain parts of the implementation.
            </p>
            <p>
                If an EDExchange member chooses to use the reference implementation of the network server, there are certain tasks
                that need to be performed to make the reference implementation live for the member.  The network server is implemented
                as a Spring Boot application and requires Java 8 to run and <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">maven</a> to build.
                It also requires a mysql database.  Depending on what
                deployment options you choose, you will most likely need <h href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a>. There are multiple options with regards to how
                to deploy and run the network server that are useful for different purposes.

                <div class="ed-title">Configuration</div>
                <p>
                    The network server application is configured using the application.properties files.  There are 3 configuration profiles:
                    <ol>
                        <li><span><b>dev</b></span>: <span>Intended for use in a development environment</span></li>
                        <li><span><b>qa</b></span>: <span>Intended for use in a quality assurance environment</span></li>
                        <li><span><b>prod</b></span>: <span>Intended for use in a production environment</span></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>You can specify the configuratio profile on the command line, when invoking the application:
                        <div>
                            <kbd>network-server.jar --spring.profiles.active=dev </kbd>
                        </div>
                        <div>Please consult the Spring documentation regarding Spring Boot configurations.
                        </div>
                    </p>
                </p>
            </p>
        <div class="ed-title">Option 1: Docker Compose</div>
        <p>This option uses docker and docker-compose to create separate VM images for the network server application and the mysql database.
            When you've completed the steps to use this option, you should be able to use a browser open to the network server running
            in a docker VM.  The IP address of the network server will depend on your docker configuration, but typically,
            http://172.17.0.3:9000 will work.
        </p>

                </p>

            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In addition, it may be desirable to run a the directory server locally, in which case there is a similar process
        for running the directory server
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                First, build the directory server...

                <p>
                    From the directory server project folder (cdsWebserver/directoryServer), run
                <p>
                    <kbd>
                        mvn -DskipTests clean package docker:build

            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Another docker compose option is to invoke "setup.sh" from the project root "cdsWebserver".  This script
            automates the build process for both the directory and network servers by building the projects, creating
            docker images and then running a the directory server and network server and their respective database images
            with docker containers.  Invoke the setup.sh script with the name of the dev profile:

            <kdb>./setup.sh dev</kdb>

            As the setup.sh script runs, it will output status of the build process. When it completes, you should
            see console output similar to following (IP addresses and hostnames may vary):

            are set to valid values.
        </p>
        <p>
            The setup.sh is paired with shutdown.sh which should be used to stop the running docker containers.
        </p>


        <div class="ed-title">Option 2: Development Script</div>
        <p>This option is intended for development.  It creates a docker image for the database, and allows the developer
            to run the network server locally, but using the database image to host the Mysql database. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>From the cdsWebserver/networkServer directory, invoke the dev-setup.sh script from the command line.

                <p>When the script completes, you should see output similar to the following:</p>

                    You can start the network server app using the following command:
                    java -Dspring.profiles.active=dev -Ddb.server=172.17.0.2 -jar ./target/network-server.jar
                    or use your favorite IDE to develop and run.
                </samp>

                <p>After the network server is started, you can navigate to http://localhost:9000 with a browser.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="ed-title">Option 3: Manual Provisioning</div>
        <p>
            You can optionally provision servers manually.  You will need a MySQL server and a server to run the
            network server application.  You may use the dev-setup.sh script as a reference for provisioning your
            servers and running the EDExchange network application.
        </p>

        <div class="ed-title">Required Changes Before Going Live</div>
        <ol>
            <li>Obtain a domain name for the network server. This will be the base address for endpoints hosted by the network server.</li>
            <li>Obtain and install an SSL certificate for the purpose of handling the HTTPS protocol for the chosen domain name.  The network server project
            implements HTTPS, but you can alternatively use a proxy server or other configuration appropriate to your organization.  HTTPS configuration and proxy
            is outside the scope of this document.</li>
            <li>Configure a mysql database server of use with the network server.</li>
            <li>Update the application-prod.properties to reflect your environment.</li>

    </p>

    <h2 id="organizations">Organizations</h2>

    <p>
        An organization is an object that represents a member of the EDExchange network. There are two types of organizations
        in the EDExchange network that have different capabilities within the network: <var>service providers</var> and <var>institutions</var>. An organization can be of
        type <var><a href="#service-provider">Service Provider</a></var>
        or <var><a href="#institutions">Institution</a></var> or both. When an organization is created, a number is assigned to it that uniquely
        idenifies the organization in the EDExchange network.
        All members of the EDExchange network are included in the searchable EDExchange directory. Operations on an organization object can be
        invoked using the <a href="/swagger-ui/index.html#!/orgnizations">organizations resource</a> of the REST API
        or
        through the directory server web application by an authenticated user with the appropriate permissions.
    </p>

    <div id="service-provider" class="ed-title">Service Providers</div>
    <p>
        An organization that is a <var>Service Provider</var> can both send and receive documents through
        EDExchange, for itself and on the behalf of organizations that are <var>institutions</var>. For an
        organization to be able to receive documents, the organization must host an EDExchange <a
            href="#network-server">network server</a>.
    </p>

    <div id="institutions" class="ed-title">Institutions</div>
    <p>
        An organization that is an <var>Institution</var> can send documents through EDExchange. To send documents,
        the organization must <a href="#certificate">publish a SSL certificate</a>, obtained from a certificate authority, to the directory server. The certificate is
        used to verify the authenticity of a document transferred through EDExchange using digital signatures.
    </p>


    <h2 id="endpoints">Endpoints</h2>

    <p>
        An endpoint is a URL and set of attributes that identify where to <a href="#send-document">send a
        document</a>. Organizations that are <var>Servcice Providers</var>
        can create, read, update and delete and assign endpoints to institutions that are serviceable by the
        provider.
        An institution can also be a service provider and can receive documents for itself. Endpoint operations can
        be
        invoked through the web application by an authenticated user with the appropriate permissions or by using
        the <a href="/swagger-ui/index.html#!/endpoints">endpoints resource</a> of the REST API.
    </p>

    <div class="ed-title" id="upload-document">multipart/form-data HTTP POST</div>
    <p>The <a href="#reference-implementation">reference implementation</a> of the network server uses a
        multipart/form-data HTTP POST as the endpoint that

        <p>
            <b>Q: </b><span>My institution wants to send transcripts to a particular school, what do I need to do?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A: </b>
                <span>First, <a href="home#/registration-form">register</a> with EDExchange as an institution (as opposed to a service provider).  If you also want to be able to
                        receive documents, you must register as an <a href="#institutions">institution</a> and a <a href="#service-provider">service provider</a>.  Consult the next FAQ below
                        for more information about receiving documents.</p>
        <p>Next,
            check if the destination school is an EDExchange member using the searchable <a href="home#/directory">directory</a>.  If the school isn't an
            EDExchange member, they need to <a href="home#/registration-form">register</a> as a member.  Also, the destination school needs to be configured to receive documents.
            The destination school must
            either configure a <a href="#network-server">network server</a>, using the <a href="#reference-implementation">reference implementation</a>
            that's provided by EDExchange, or alternatively, use an EDExchange <a href="#service-provider"> service provider</a> to receive documents on their behalf. Service providers are
            listed in the searchable <a href="home#/directory">directory</a>.
        <p>
            After you've registered your institution, you'll need to obtain an <a href="#certificate">SSL certificate</a> from a certificate authority and upload it
            to the directory server.  Once you have your certificate with the corresponding private key, you can use either the free reference implementation of the network
            server to <a href="#send-document">send a document</a>. Optionally, you'll need a software developer to extend or implement
            a customized software program.

        <p>
            <b>A: </b>.
                     <span>First, you must <a href="home#/registration-form">register</a> with EDExchange as both an <a href="#institutions">institution</a> and a <a href="#service-provider">provider</a>.  As a service provider, your
                        institution will be able both send and receive documents.

                           <p>
                               After you have been registered and are a member of the EDExchange network, your are required to host a <a href="#network-server">network server</a> on the internet
                               using a domain name of your choosing (E.g. edexchange.butte.edu).
                               A free <a href="#reference-implementation">reference implementation</a> of the network server can be used. Optionally the reference implementation can be extended by a software developer to add or customize
                               features, but the reference network server has the ability to both send and receive documents. If your institution intends to send documents, you'll have to
                               provide an SSL certificate and install the corresponding private key so that is accessible to the network server.  Other configuration changes to the reference
                               implementation of the network server are required too, such as the installation of a second SSL certificate used to encrypt data communications with the network server
                               over the internet using HTTPS. Alternatively, you may configure HTTPS using a load balancer/proxy.

    <h2 id="transfer-document">Transfer a Document</h2>


    <ol>
        <li>
            The sender queries the directory server for the directory ID of the recipient
            institution using various search criteria such as the school's name, ATP code or FICE code.
        </li>

        <li>
            The sender queries the directory server to <a href="#find-endpoint">find an endpoint</a>
            (a URL that identifies where to send a document using HTTP) that fulfills the required
            criteria including the document type (Transcript or Transcript Request), the file format of
            the document (PDF, text, XML, etc.), the name of the institution's department to deliver to
            and the directory ID of the recipient insitution.
        </li>

        <li>
            The sender <a href="#sign-document">digitally signs the document</a> with a private key that is paired with
            the SSL certificate's public key supplied to the directory server.
        </li>

        <li>
            The sender optionally creates a transaction used to track the document transfer.
        </li>

        <li>
            The sender <a href="#send-document">sends a document</a> to the endpoint using HTTPS along with the document's
            digital signature, the sender's directory ID, the recipient's directory ID, the file
            format, the document type and destination department name and optionally, a transaction
            id and acknowledegment URL.
        </li>

        <li>
            The receiving network server queries the directory server for the sender's
            signing certificate and <a href="#verify-signature">verifies the digital signature</a> of the document.
        </li>

        <li>
            The receiving network server handles the document appropriately (E.g. delivers a
            transcript to the recipient, send back a transcript in response to a transcript request) based
            on the recipient ID, the document type etc.
        </li>

        <li>
            The receiving network server creates a transaction to log the event.
        </li>

        <li>
            The receiving network server sends an acknowledgement back to the sender using
            the acknowledgement URL and transaction ID provided by the sender (if present).
        </li>


        <li>
            The sender's network server updates the transaction with the acknowledgement.
        </li>


    </ol>

    <h2 id="certificate">Publish a SSL Certificate</h2>

    <p>
        An SSL certificate is required to send and receive documents through the EDExchange network.
        The authenticity of documents tranferred within the EDExchange network is verified using the
        SSL certificate provided by the sender for the purpose of generating digital signatures.
        <p>
        Before an organization can send a document, it must obtain a certificate from a certficate authority
        and upload the certificate to the EDExchange directory server
        using the website or by updating the signing-certificate property on the <a

    <p>
        One of the attributes of an <a href="#endpoints">endpoint</a> that can be used in the search criteria is the <a href="/services/rest/v1/document-types">document type</a>
        name.  Endpoints that are intended to handle transcript requests should specify "Transcript Request" as the document type. When an EDExchange
        member wishes to request a transcript from a particular institution, the search for an appropriate endpoint (one
        that specifies "Transcript Request" as the document type.

    <div class="well">
        <ol>

        multiple service providers.</p>
    <p>The <a href="swagger-ui/index.html#!/service-providers">service providers</a> resource can be used to operate on serviceable institutions including
        <a href="swagger-ui/index.html#!/service-providers/getServiceProvidersForInstitution">updating</a> the serviceable institutions for a service provider.</p>


    <div class="ed-title" id="multiple-endpoints">Multiple Providers for an Institution</div>
    <p>It is possible, if unlikely, for a institution to have multiple service providers.  This means that when the EDExchange directory is queried for an endpoint, multiple
    endpoints will be returned to the API caller.  In this case, it is up to the caller to select which endpoint in which to send the document. </p>


    <h2 id="upload-serviceable-institutions-csv">Upload Serviceable Institutions CSV</h2>
    <p>
        The EDExchange web application allows authenticated users of the service provider to upload a <a href="assets/upload-template.csv">CSV file</a> where each row in the file creates an institution and adds it
        to the provider's group of serviceable institutions.
        Alterntively, service providers can use the <a href="/swagger-ui/index.html#!/institutions">institution</a> API resource by first <a href="swagger-ui/index.html#!/institutions/createInstitution">creating</a>
        the institution and then adding the institution to the service provider's group of serviceable institutions using the

    <h2 id="assign-endpoint">Assign an Endpoint</h2>
    <p>
        In order to receive documents of behalf of a serviceable institution, the service provider must associate
        one or more endpoints with the institution. This can be done using the EDExchange web application by an
        authenticated user with the appropriate permissions, or by using the organizations API resource.
    </p>


    <h2 id="manage-school-codes">Manage School Codes</h2>
    <p>
        There are a number of attributes that are used by the API that are used to search the EDExchange
        directory for institutions and <a href="#endpoints">endpoints</a>.  The attributes include different
        types of school codes.

        EDExchange supports and validates the following school codes:

    <ul class="square-style" style="margin-left: 15px;">
        <li><b>FICE</b><span>: 6 digits</span></li>
        <li><b>ATP</b><span>: 6 digits</span></li>
        <li><b>ACT</b><span>: 4 digits</span></li>
        <li><b>IPEDS</b><span>: 6 digits</span></li>
        <li><b>OPEID</b> <span>: 8 digits</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        School codes can be managed through the directory server web application by an authenticated user
        with the appropriate permissions.  School codes can also be managed using the
        <a href="/swagger-ui/index.html#!/school-codes/createSchoolCode">school codes resource</a> or alternatively
        by using the school-codes property of the <a href="/swagger-ui/index.html#!/organizations/putSchoolCode">organizations resource</a>.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2 id="manage-contacts">Manage Contacts</h2>
    <p>
        EDExchange member organizations can have one or more contacts that are presented in the
        EDExchange public directory.  Contact information is intended to provide users the abiltity to contact the organization for
        support, questions, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Contacts can be managed through the EDExchange directory server web application by an authenticated user
        with the appropriate permissions.  Contacts can also be managed using the <a href="/swagger-ui/index.html#!/contacts">contacts resource</a>
        of the API.
    </p>
    <h2 id="manage-users">Manage Users</h2>
    <p>
        The EDExchange directory server web application provides the ability for each organization, both service providers and institutions, to maintain a group of
        users that can manage their organization using through the web application.
    </p>
    <p>
        An organization's users can be managed through the directory server web application by an authenticated user with the appropriate permissions.  Alternatively,
        users can be managed by operating on the <a href="swagger-ui/index.html#!/users">users resource</a> of the API.

        <li>
            Receiver extracts the public key from the certificate and generates a digital signature for the document.

        <li>
            Receive compares the generated digital signature with the digital signature provided by the sender with
            the document.
        </li>

    </ol>


    <h2 id="#registration">Register an Organization</h2>
    <p>
        There are various ways in which an organization object can be added to the EDExchange network.

        <p>
            New applicants can register by filling out the <a href="home#/registration-form">registration form</a>. The registration
            automatically creates an administrator account for the individual listed in the registration form as the contact.  This account
    has administrator priveleges for the organization.  After the
    form is submitted, the organization's administrator will receive an email notification regarding the registration.  At that point, the organization is
    listed in the EDExchange directory, but disabled.  It will remain disabled until a PESC administrator reviews and approves the
    information that was provided in the registration form.  The organization's administrator can conduct normal operations such as setting up the
    <a href="#network-server">network server</a> and <a href="#certificate">publishing a SSL certificate</a>, while
    the application is being reviewed.
        </p>
        <p>
            An orgnanization can also be created directly by an PESC administrator.
        </p>
    <p>
            Organization's that are <var><a href="#institutions">institutions</a></var> can be created by a <a href="#service-provider">service provider</a> for the purpose
        of adding the institution to the provider's group of <a href="#create-serviceable-institution">serviceable institutions</a>.  Institutions that are created in this
        way must also be reviewed and approved by a PESC administrator.
    </p>
    In each case,
        a PESC administrator is required to review and approve the organization.  When a new organization record is created,
        it is disabled in EDExchange as shown in the directory. Once the PESC administrator approves the organization, it
        becomes enabled in the EDExchange direcory.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2 id="receive-document">Receive a Document</h2>
    <p>
        Organizations that are service providers must host a <a href="#network-server">network server</a> in order
        to receive documents and publish the certificate used to handle HTTPS. The reference implementation of the network server uses a
        <a href="#upload-document">multipart/form-data HTTP POST</a> endpoint to receive documents.
    </p>

    <p>
        The use case below describes the steps required to receive a document.
